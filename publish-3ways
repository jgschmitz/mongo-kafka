The following mapping instructs the connector to perform the following actions:

Publish change stream documents originating from the myDb.myColl MongoDB collection to the topicOne Kafka topic.

Publish change stream documents originating from the myDb MongoDB database and a collection other than myColl to the Kafka topic topicTwo.<collectionName>.

Publish change stream documents originating from the myDb MongoDB database that do not bear a collection name to the topicTwo Kafka topic.

topic.namespace.map={"myDb.myColl": "topicOne", "myDb": "topicTwo"}
The following examples show which topic the connector sends different change stream documents to using the preceding mapping:

A change stream document originating from the myDb database and the myColl collection publishes to the topicOne topic.

A change stream document originating from the myDb database and the newColl collection publishes to the topicTwo.newColl topic.

A change stream document originating from dropping the myDb database, which does not bear a collection name, publishes to the topicTwo topic.

You can use the "*" wildcard character to match change stream document namespaces.
EXAMPLE
The following mapping instructs the connector to publish all change stream documents to the topicThree topic:

topic.namespace.map={"*": "topicThree"}
